# PyDictionary
 
 What does this do:
    This is a command line dictionary program. 
    It allows users to get definitions for a given keyword. If no definition can be found for a given keyword, the program provides a list or related words. 

Requirements:
    This must be run with Python 3

 Usage:
    $> python pyDictionary.py 

 Purpose:
    This is my shot at writing a python script/program and was meant to be a learning experience.
    What did I learn?... It's significantly easier/faster to write code in Python than C-based languages. 
    I might do the equivalent in C# just for a line by line comparison.
